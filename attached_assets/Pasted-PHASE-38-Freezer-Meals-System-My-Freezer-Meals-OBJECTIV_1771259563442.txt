PHASE 38 — Freezer Meals System ("My Freezer Meals")

OBJECTIVE:
Allow users to store cooked meals in their freezer inventory, add them to planner, and prevent duplicate ingredient shopping.

PART 4 — Planner Integration

User must be able to add freezer meal to planner.

Planner display should show:

Snowflake icon
Label:

Planner logic:

DO NOT add ingredients to shopping list for freezer meals.

PART 5 — Shopping List Behaviour

When freezer meal added to shopping list:

Shopping list must display:

Column:

Type: Freezer Meal

Row display example:

Chicken Curry — Freezer Meal
Status: Already in freezer
Icon: Snowflake

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT include ingredients.

Only include:

Ready Meal

Freezer rows show:

Snowflake icon
Text:

In Freezer

Row styling:

Slight blue background tint

PART 7 — Basket and Planner Logic Update

Update shopping list generator:

If meal source == freezer

Skip ingredient expansion

Add single meal reference row instead

PART 8 — Freezer Inventory Tracking Logic

When freezer meal added to planner:

Reduce portionsAvailable by 1

If portionsAvailable == 0

Remove from freezer list OR mark as depleted

PART 9 — Dashboard Widget (Premium Feature)

Add dashboard widget:

Freezer Inventory

Example display:

Freezer Inventory

8 meals available
12 portions total

Button:

View Freezer Meals

PART 10 — Meal Widget Indicator

On My Meals page, if meal exists in freezer:

Show badge:

In Freezer (3 portions)

PART 11 — API Endpoints

Create endpoints:

POST /api/freezer/add

GET /api/freezer/meals

POST /api/freezer/use

DELETE /api/freezer/remove

PART 12 — Visual UX Rules (Important)

Freezer meals must be visually distinct:

Use:

Snowflake icon
Blue accent color
Label:

Freezer Meal

NOT confused with normal meals

Expected Final Behaviour Example

User flow:

User cooks chilli → adds to freezer (4 portions)

Freezer inventory shows:

Chilli
4 portions

User adds chilli to planner Wednesday

Planner shows:

Chilli ❄ Freezer Meal

Shopping list shows:

Chilli
Status: In Freezer ❄
(no ingredients listed)

Result

This creates a true freezer inventory system.

This is a major premium feature competitors lack.
