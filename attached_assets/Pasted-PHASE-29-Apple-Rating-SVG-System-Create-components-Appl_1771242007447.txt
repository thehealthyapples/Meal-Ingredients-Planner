PHASE 29 — Apple Rating SVG System

Create:

components/AppleRating.tsx

Requirements:

Use inline SVG (not image files)

Accept props:

rating: number (1–5)

hasCape: boolean

size: small | medium | large

Component should:

Render correct apple expression per rating

Render multiple apples in row

Apply glow for rating >=4

Render gold cape overlay if hasCape = true

Animate slight bounce on load (CSS animation 0.4s ease-out)

Use flexbox for row layout.

End phase.

3️⃣ Micro-Interaction Animation System

Premium apps feel alive. Subtle only.

Animation Rules
On rating load:

Apples fade in 0.2s

Slight upward bounce 4px

5-apple glow pulses once (very subtle)

On hover (desktop):

Apples scale 1.05

Tooltip appears:
“SMP Rating: 5 — Elite Whole Food”

On product analyse result:

If score drops:
Apples briefly shake left-right 2px

If score increases:
Soft green flash behind apples

Add this to Replit:

Add CSS:

@keyframes appleBounce {
0% { transform: translateY(6px); opacity: 0; }
60% { transform: translateY(-3px); opacity: 1; }
100% { transform: translateY(0); }
}

@keyframes glowPulse {
0% { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0px #3CB043); }
50% { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 6px #3CB043); }
100% { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0px #3CB043); }
}

Apply conditionally for rating === 5.

End phase.
