Upgrade the existing SmartMeal Planner Node.js app to support importing recipes from a URL.

Use the existing stack:

Node.js

Express

SQLite

HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript

Add the following new feature:

RECIPE IMPORT FROM URL

New page:
Create a page called "Import Recipe" accessible from the dashboard.

The page must contain:

Input field for recipe URL

Submit button

Area to preview extracted recipe name and ingredients before saving

Backend endpoint:
Create a new POST endpoint:

POST /import-recipe

This endpoint should:

Accept a recipe URL from the frontend

Fetch the HTML from the URL using node-fetch or axios

Parse the HTML

Extract:

Recipe title (from tag or h1)

Ingredients (from common patterns like , elements containing "ingredient", or structured data)

Return JSON:
{
title: "...",
ingredients: ["ingredient 1", "ingredient 2"]
}

Ingredient extraction logic:
Implement a simple extraction approach:

Look for elements

Filter lines containing measurements (g, kg, ml, cup, tsp, tbsp)

Filter lines between 3 and 100 characters

Remove duplicates

Keep logic simple and readable.

Save imported recipe:
Add another POST endpoint:

POST /save-imported-recipe

This should:

Save the recipe title into meals table

Save each ingredient into ingredients table

Link to logged-in user

Frontend functionality:
Import Recipe page should:

Let user paste URL

Click "Import"

Show preview of recipe name and ingredients

Show "Save Recipe" button

Save into user's meals when clicked

Navigation:
Add "Import Recipe" link to dashboard and meals page.

File structure:
Add new files if needed:
/routes/import.js
/views/import.html
/public/import.js

Requirements:

Use axios or node-fetch for fetching web pages

Use cheerio for HTML parsing

Add clear comments explaining each part

Handle errors gracefully

Only allow logged-in users

Installation:
Add required dependencies to package.json:

axios

cheerio

Final step:
Explain how the import feature works and how to use it.

Modify the existing project without breaking current functionality.
